Project name:  CSS and Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

Description: Using CSS and Bootstrap I coded three unique pages that are mobile responsive. 

Table of Contents: 
	1) About Page: showing an image wrapped with text inside a card 
	2) Portfolio Page with a two column, multi-row image gallery with text overlay 
	3) Contact Page with contact form 

Problems still still need to solve: 

1. Can’t get header navigation to go vertical 
2. Can’t get header to be fixed and nav to be sticky - have them backwards 
3. Can’t get any of the main text containers to scroll all the way through 
4. Not sure how to get cards to point left on desktop and then fill screen for mobile 
5. On Portfolio - can’t get rid of padding around the card title’s 
6. On Portfolio - can’t get the card title’s to stay within the box
